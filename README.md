Requirements
------------

WPRavenAuth requires hosting *within the University of Cambridge network*, so that it may perform LDAP lookups, which is what we use to determine College and so on. Other than that it can run on any webserver (it doesn't require `mod_ucam_webauth`).

The plugin does require PHP > 5.3 because it uses the namespace construct, which was introduced in PHP 5.3.

Installation
------------

Install the plugin as you would a normal WP plugin (don't forget to pull the git submodule dependency), then create a directory called "keys" in the plugin directory (that's "WPRavenAuth" or whatever you called it, not the `wp-content/plugins` directory), and add the files from https://raven.cam.ac.uk/project/keys/ (but call them *2* and *2.crt* instead of *pubkey2* and *pubkey2.crt*).

Once you've done that, activate the plugin and go to the WPRavenAuth settings in the Wordpress Dashboard (under Settings). Here you can configure which colleges should be available to select for individual post or page visibility. You MUST also change the salt to be a long random string with alphanumeric characters and punctuation, which is used for making secure passwords. You MUST do this before attempting to log in any users with Raven.

Note that the php_override.ini file included in the root of the plugin directory should be moved to the root of your public_html directory if you are using the SRCF server for hosting. This is required to enable to allow_fopen_url directive, which Ibis requires to function.

Usage
-----

The plugin will replace the login system with a Raven login page - if a user who has never used your site before logs in with their Raven account, a new Wordpress account will be automatically created for them (with their CRSID as the name of the account).

NB: You can access the original Wordpress Login by adding `?super-admin=1` to your login url (e.g. `http://www.mywebsite.com/wp-login.php?super-admin=1`).

If any existing users are set up with their univeristy email addresses *@cam.ac.uk* for the email field, they will never be able to log in with the new system (unless their username is also their crsid in lower case). If such users exist, they should be deleted, or if their username is NOT their crsid, they can change the email associated with their user to an external (i.e. non *@cam.ac.uk*) address. This should be done before activating this plugin.

By default, these new users with have *Subscriber* permissions. To promote a user to another permission level, find their account in the normal Wordpress *Users* section and modify it in the normal manner.

To use the visibility settings, you can select the desired levels of visibility for any page or post individually. These options should appear as custom fields on every post or page. You can also configure the error message which is displayed to users with insufficient privilidges to view the content.
