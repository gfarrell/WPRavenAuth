/**
 * Methods for querying and manipulating people.
 *
 * **Notes on the fetch parameter**
 *
 * All methods that return people, institutions or groups also accept an
 * optional ``fetch`` parameter that may be used to request
 * additional information about the entities returned. Without this
 * parameter, only a few basic details about each person, institution or
 * group are returned. The ``fetch`` parameter is quite flexible,
 * and may be used in a number of different ways:
 *
 * * **Attribute fetching**. Attributes may be fetched by specifying the
 *   ``schemeid`` of an attribute scheme. For example to fetch a
 *   person's email addresses, use the value ``"email"``. For people common
 *   attribute schemes include ``"jpegPhoto"``, ``"misAffiliation"``,
 *   ``"title"``, ``"universityPhone"``, ``"mobexPhone"``,
 *   ``"landlinePhone"``, ``"mobilePhone"``, ``"pager"``,
 *   ``"labeledURI"`` and ``"address"``. The full list of person
 *   attribute schemes may be obtained using {@link allAttributeSchemes}.
 *
 * * **Pseudo-attributes**. Certain special pseudo-attributes are defined
 *   for convenience. For people, the following pseudo-attributes are supported:
 *
 *   * ``"phone_numbers"`` - fetches all phone numbers. This is
 *     equivalent to
 *     ``"universityPhone,instPhone,mobexPhone,landlinePhone,mobilePhone,pager"``.
 *
 *   * ``"all_identifiers"`` - fetches all identifiers. Currently people
 *     only have CRSid identifiers, but in the future additional identifiers such
 *     as USN or staffNumber may be added.
 *
 *   * ``"all_attrs"`` - fetches all attributes from all person attribute
 *     schemes. This does not include identifiers or references.
 *
 * * **Reference fetching**. For people, the following references are
 *   supported (and will fetch only non-cancelled institutions and groups):
 *
 *   * ``"all_insts"`` - fetches all the institutions to which the person
 *     belongs (sorted in name order).
 *
 *   * ``"all_groups"`` - fetches all the groups that the person is a
 *     member of, including indirect group memberships, via groups that include
 *     other groups.
 *
 *   * ``"direct_groups"`` - fetches all the groups that the person is
 *     directly a member of. This does not include indirect group memberships -
 *     i.e., groups that include these groups.
 *
 * * **Chained reference fetching**. To fetch properties of referenced
 *   objects, the "dot" notation may be used. For example, to fetch the email
 *   addresses of all the institutions to which a person belongs, use
 *   ``"all_insts.email"``. Chains may include a number of reference
 *   following steps, for example
 *   ``"all_insts.managed_by_groups.all_members.email"`` will fetch all the
 *   institutions to which the person belongs, all the groups that manage those
 *   institutions, all the visible members of those groups and all the email
 *   addresses of those managing group members. For more information about what
 *   can be fetched from referenced institutions and groups, refer to the
 *   documentation for {@link InstitutionMethods} and {@link GroupMethods}.
 *
 * Multiple values of the ``fetch`` parameter should be separated
 * by commas.
 *
 * **Fetch parameter examples**
 *
 * ``fetch = "email"``
 * This fetches all the person's email addresses.
 *
 * ``fetch = "title,address"``
 * This fetches all the person's titles (roles) and addresses.
 *
 * ``fetch = "all_attrs"``
 * This fetches all the person's attributes.
 *
 * ``fetch = "all_groups,all_insts"``
 * This fetches all the groups and institutions to which the person belongs.
 *
 * ``fetch = "all_insts.parent_insts"``
 * This fetches all the person's institutions, and their parent institutions.
 *
 * ``fetch = "all_insts.email,all_insts.all_members.email"``
 * This fetches all the person's institutions and their email addresses, and
 * all the members of those institutions, and the email addresses of all
 * those members.
