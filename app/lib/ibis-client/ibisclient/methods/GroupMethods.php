/**
 * Methods for querying and manipulating groups.
 *
 * **The fetch parameter for groups**
 *
 * All methods that return groups also accept an optional ``fetch``
 * parameter that may be used to request additional information about the
 * groups returned. For more details about the general rules that apply to
 * the ``fetch`` parameter, refer to the {@link PersonMethods}
 * documentation.
 *
 * For groups the ``fetch`` parameter may be used to fetch references
 * to people, institutions or other groups. In each case, only non-cancelled
 * people, institutions and groups will be included when fetching references.
 * The following references are supported:
 *
 * * ``"all_members"`` - fetches all the people who are members of the
 *   group, including members of groups included by the group, and groups
 *   included by those groups, and so on.
 *
 * * ``"direct_members"`` - fetches all the poeple who are direct
 *   members of the group, not taking into account any included groups.
 *
 * * ``"members_of_inst"`` - if the group is a membership group for an
 *   institution, this fetches that institution.
 *
 * * ``"owning_insts"`` - fetches all the institutions to which the
 *   group belongs.
 *
 * * ``"manages_insts"`` - fetches all the institutions that the group
 *   manages. Typically this only applies to "Editor" groups.
 *
 * * ``"manages_groups"`` - fetches all the groups that this group
 *   manages. Note that some groups are self-managed, so this may be a
 *   self-reference.
 *
 * * ``"managed_by_groups"`` - fetches all the groups that manage this
 *   group.
 *
 * * ``"reads_groups"`` - fetches all the groups that this group has
 *   privileged access to. This means that members of this group can see the
 *   members of the referenced groups regardless of the membership visibility
 *   settings.
 *
 * * ``"read_by_groups"`` - fetches all the groups that have privileged
 *   access to this group.
 *
 * * ``"includes_groups"`` - fetches all the groups included by this
 *   group.
 *
 * * ``"included_by_groups"`` - fetches all the groups that include
 *   this group.
 *
 * As with person ``fetch`` parameters, the references may be used
 * in a chain by using the "dot" notation to fetch additional information
 * about referenced people, institutions or groups. For example
 * ``"all_members.email"`` will fetch the email addresses of all members
 * of the group. For more information about what can be fetched from
 * referenced people and institutions, refer to the documentation for
 * {@link PersonMethods} and {@link InstitutionMethods}.
